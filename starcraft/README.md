# First of all

Hi my name is Willas and this is a silly project to can practice macro cycles on starcraft outside of the game

# THE IDEA

I was asking myselff about how to practice my macro cycle as Terran, and I said well I can spam on a txt the right order of the cycle so I said to msyself. Why not doing an online application for this shit? And here I am.

### First Part

- Counts APMs as every keypress on the keyboard (and not counting the control group keys or tab).
- Have AVG APMs vs Puntual APMs
